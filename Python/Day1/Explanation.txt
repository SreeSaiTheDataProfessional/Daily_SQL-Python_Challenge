Understanding the Two Sum solution

The problem asks for two indices whose values add up to the target.
Instead of using a slow double loop, this solution uses a dictionary for instant lookups.

Step-by-step logic

1. Create a dictionary (numMap)
Keys → numbers from the list
Values → their indices

This lets us check very quickly whether a needed complement exists.

2. Loop through the list again
For each number:

Compute complement = target - nums[i]

Check if complement exists in the dictionary

Make sure it's not the same index

Return the pair of indices

This reduces the time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).

Why this works well

Dictionary lookups are constant time, which makes this approach fast even for large input sizes.
It’s a clean example of how using the right data structure simplifies your logic.
