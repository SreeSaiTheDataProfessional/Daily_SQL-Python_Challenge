Explanation

The goal is to remove duplicate values from a sorted linked list.

How the code works
n = head


n is a pointer that moves through the list.

while n and n.next:


We loop as long as there is a current node and a next node to compare.

Duplicate check
if n.val == n.next.val:
    n.next = n.next.next


If the current value and next value are the same, we skip the next node.
This effectively removes the duplicate from the list.

We do not move n forward here, because after removing one duplicate, the next node might still be a duplicate.

Move forward when values differ
else:
    n = n.next


If it’s not a duplicate, just continue to the next node.

Return the cleaned list
return head

What it achieves

Removes consecutive duplicates in a sorted list.

Runs in O(n) time and O(1) space.

Modifies the list in-place using pointer adjustments.
