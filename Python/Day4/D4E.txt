1. Create an empty result array
res = [0] * len(nums)


You prepare a list filled with zeros.
This will eventually hold the squared numbers in sorted order.

2. Set two pointers
left = 0
right = len(nums) - 1


left starts at the beginning

right starts at the end

These two will help compare the biggest values (by absolute value) on both ends.

3. Fill the result array from the back
for i in range(len(nums)-1, -1, -1):


You fill res starting from the last index (i = end) down to the front.

Why?
Because the largest square goes at the end of the sorted list.

4. Compare absolute values
if abs(nums[left]) > abs(nums[right]):


Whichever side has the number with the bigger absolute value:

That number, when squared, will be larger

So that square should be placed at position i

5. Place the square and move the pointer
If left is bigger:
res[i] = nums[left] ** 2
left += 1


You use the left value, square it, and move left forward.

Otherwise:
res[i] = nums[right] ** 2
right -= 1


Use the right value and move right backward.

6. After loop finishes

All positions in res are filled in sorted (non-decreasing) order.

return res
