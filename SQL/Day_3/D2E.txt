It finds the second-highest salary from the employee table.

🔍 How it works, step by step
1. select distinct salary

This pulls all unique salary values.
If many employees have the same salary, duplicates are removed.

Example:
If salaries are 100, 200, 200, 300,
distinct makes it 100, 200, 300.

2. order by salary desc

Sorts the salaries from highest to lowest.

Example:
300, 200, 100

3. limit 1 offset 1

This part picks a specific row after sorting.

offset 1 → skip the first row (highest salary)

limit 1 → take the next row only

So after skipping the highest salary, the next one is the second-highest.

🎯 Final Output

The query returns one value:

second_highest_salary


Which is the second-largest salary in the table.
